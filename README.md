## Executive Summary

## Problem statement
Work as a data scientist for a manager of artists that depend on music sample backdrops.  The manager is worried about the exponentially increasing expenses with clearing samples for his artists beats. If a model can generate new music from existing jazz works to have a bigger collection from which to sample from in house, we can scale up and create sounds with other genres.  This could really help the finances of the business by decreasing the reliance of those expenditures.  Could even be used to inspire artists in house to aid in creating organic sounds.  
## Software Requirements
Numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, keras,
## Description of Dataset

The dataset is comprised of midi files scraped from https://bushgrafts.com/midi/.  These midi files are of the jazz genre, while 301 files were scraped some of them need to be reformatted in order to go through the processing via the music 21 library. The dataset also includes 295 classical music midi files that were found on kaggle here, https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi.
